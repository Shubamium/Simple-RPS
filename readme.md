# Simple RPS

A basic Web Based Rock Paper Scissors game made with/for practicing React.js, This is also my try at moving over to some of the more modern and minimalistic look of a website instead of my usual all over the place anime themed sites.

I will be doing more and more modern style websites from now on to diverse my portfolios.

## Component Used:
- React.js
- Styled Components (Styling)
- Framer Motion (Animation)
